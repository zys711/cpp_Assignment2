Purpose
-------

This project serves as a starting point for the PHAS0100 Assignment 2 Gravitational N-body Simulation coursework. It has a reasonable folder structure for [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based projects,
that use [CTest](https://cmake.org/) to run unit tests via [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). 

Further information on the specific project is left as an exercise for the student.


Credits
-------

This project is maintained by [Dr. Jim Dobson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jim-dobson). It is based on [CMakeCatch2](https://github.com/UCL/CMakeCatch2.git) that was originally developed as a teaching aid for UCL's ["Research Computing with C++"](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/research-computing-with-cpp/)
course developed by [Dr. James Hetherington](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/james)
and [Dr. Matt Clarkson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42).


Build Instructions
------------------

Build and run instructions are left as an excercise for the student. Examples of how to build using cmake were given in lectures and in the other CMake example projects.


Instructions
------------

build file has already been created:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Tests run as:
```
ctest
```

Command Line App
----------------
This app is a solar system simulator. 8 planets and the fixed star Sun have already been set up. There are two input values, stepsize(year) and totaltime(year).
To run this app, and with two parameters:
```
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s stepsize -t totaltime
```

Result
------

The example result with stepsize 0.000274 year(1 day) and totaltime 1 year:

The benchmark timesteps are 1 hour, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 5 days. Also the squared errors was calculated compared with earth position (âˆ’0.194, 0.969, 0.000109).

From the result we can see with the timestep decreases (for loop count increases), the benchmark time increases roughly linearly. Also, the sqaured error increases as timestep increases.
